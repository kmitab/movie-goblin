## omdb-g

I started this project to help me learn the following:

- Angular
- TypeScript
- **RxJS**
- Bootstrap

## demo

Coming soon (hopefully).

## omdb

This project uses the excellent [omdb api](https://www.omdbapi.com/).

## backend

Fastapi-based python backend (such as it is) resides in `/_backend`. It's only real purpose is to not expose the api key (stored in `/_backend/config.json`) to the frontend.

Naturally, you need to obtain your own omdb api key if you want to play around with this project.
